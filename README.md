In the data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks:

### Data analysis
I wrote some interesting DAX syntax to calculate columns and metrics
```DAX
AGE 2 = DATEDIFF(medallists[birth_date],TODAY(),YEAR)
RANK = RANKX(medals_total, medals_total[Points total])
Points total = medals_total[Gold total] + medals_total[Silver total]  + medals_total[Bronze total]
```
